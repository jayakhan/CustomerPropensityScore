# customer-propensity-score

We will predict the customer propensity score using regression model to predict relationship between user's interactions with the site and their buying decision.
Although there are many ways to do this, we will start with the simple linear regression to understand this relationship.

We were given data about user's interactions with the site, such as 'download pdf', 'add to cart', and 'sign in', using which we will try to estimate propentisity score.

Ques from Marketer - Give me a list of audiences from yesterday who didn't purchase anything but are high prospects for our new re-targeting campaign.
